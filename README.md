This Project is equipped with serving as a tool to ease the usage of the Sanskriti Canteen. I have included features such as adding new orders, managing existing ones, as well as displaying and providing inventory for not only single-item orders but also for multi-faceted ones. It was a fun project that helped me use all my C++ knowledge stretching back to the basics such as cin, getline etc. to more complex topics such as Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures.
